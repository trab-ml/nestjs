# Wezaart (WZT)

Social network for artists.

Differents kind of profiles on wzt (based on old version business logic):

- Artist
- Broadcaster
- Partner
- Provider
- Public

Given a profile p

- p could
  - update its personal informations (except it's name...)
  - get a list of other profiles
  - post some content
  - repost / share a content
  - Add tags (ex.: #artists, #events, #weekend, #vibes...) while posting
  - delete a post
  - suscribe to others accounts
  - have followers

- When p is an Artist
  - p could / couldn't...

**Create a REST API to perform those operations.**
